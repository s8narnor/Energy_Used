# Energy_Used
In recent years, fog and haze occurred frequently, due to energy crises and environmental pollution. Fog and haze have significant scattering-weakening effect on solar radiation, resulting in a severe weaken to solar radiation received on a horizontal surface. In this project, air quality index (AQI) is taken as an additional input parameter, and some new models for estimating global solar radiation on a horizontal surface are proposed based on a Random Forest. The accuracy of regression models are compared and analyzed, and the results show that the performance of Random Forest model with an extra input parameter AQI are generally improved, foisr which predicted the energy used as 276.9. Compared with existing models, the Regression models proposed in this paper can improve the accuracy of global solar radiation models. If AQI is used as an additional input parameter to estimate global solar radiation, the accuracy will be further improved.
